;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, 1995
;;
;;      This started as a very little project when
;;      <mosh@ramanujan.cs.albany.edu> (Mohsin-Ahmed) 1995-03-17 in
;;      gnu.emacs.help post asked for easy way to assign newly created
;;      macro to some key. In reponse the author sent a simple function to do
;;      it, but he informaed that one macro, which was recycled every time,
;;      was too little. That little function was start of this package.
;;
;; Description
;;
;;      o   Two keystrokes to make a macro: one to record, one to
;;          assign it to key.
;;      o   To see the macro assignments to keys, just call `tinymacro-macro-info'
;;      o   Default macro count is 10, increase with `tinymacro--stack-max'
